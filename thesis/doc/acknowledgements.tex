I would like to thank my major professor, Dr. Ming Li, for his continual guidance. His analysis, suggestions, and descriptions of possible attacks were instrumental in developing and solidifying this work. I would also like to extend thanks for the rest of my committee: Dr. Dan Watson and Dr. Nick Flann for their support. 

I would also like to thank Tor developers Roger Dingledine, Yawning Angel, and Nick Mathewson for their assistance with Tor technical support, Sarbajit Mukherjee for his commentary, and the Tor community for their continued support of OnioNS.
