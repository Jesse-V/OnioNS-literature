The Tor network is a second-generation onion routing system that aims to provide anonymity, privacy, and Internet censorship resistance to its users. In recent years it has grown significantly in response to revelations of national and global electronic surveillance, and remains one of the most popular and secure anonymity network in use today. Tor is also known for its support of anonymous websites within its network. Decentralized and secure, the domain names for these services are tied to public key infrastructure (PKI) but have usability challenges due to their long and technical addresses. In response to this difficulty, I propose and partially implement a decentralized DNS system inside the Tor network. The system provides a secure and verifiable mapping between human-meaningful names and traditional Tor hidden service addresses, is backwards- and forwards-compatible with Tor hidden service infrastructure, and preserves the anonymity of the hidden service and its operator.
