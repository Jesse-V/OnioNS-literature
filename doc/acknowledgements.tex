\begin{dedication}

I would like to thank my major professor, Dr. Ming Li, for his continual guidance. His analysis, suggestions, and descriptions of possible attacks were instrumental in developing and solidifying this work. I would also like to extend thanks for the rest of my committee: Dr. Dan Watson and Dr. Nick Flann for their support. 

I would also like to thank Tor developers Mark Ellzey, Yawning Angel, and Nick Mathewson for their assistance with libevent and Tor technical support, Sarbajit Mukherjee for his commentary and suggestions on this work, and the Tor community for their continued support of OnioNS.
