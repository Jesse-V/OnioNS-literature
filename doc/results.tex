\section{Implementation}

We use the BSD-licensed Botan library and C++11 for the hash and digest algorithms in our reference implementation, while the Mersenne Twister is implemented in C++'s Standard Template Library.

Our reference implementation uses the libjsoncpp header-only library for encoding and decoding purposes. The library is also available as the libjsoncpp-dev package in the Debian, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint repositories.
