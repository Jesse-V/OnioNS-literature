The Tor network is a third-generation onion router that aims to provide private and anonymous Internet access to its users. In recent years its userbase, network, and community has grown significantly in response to revelations of national and global electronic surveillance, and it remains one of the most popular anonymity networks in use today. Tor also provides access to anonymous servers known as hidden services -- servers of unknown location and ownership that may provide websites, chat services, or an electronic dead drop. These hidden services can be accessed through any Tor-powered web browser but they suffer from usability challenges due to the algorithmic generation and unmemorability of hidden service addresses. In response to this difficulty, in this work we introduce the Onion Name System (OnioNS), a distributed DNS that provides unique owner-selected domain names to Tor hidden services. OnioNS can be embedded in any fully-connected onion router, though here we describe its application inside the Tor network.
