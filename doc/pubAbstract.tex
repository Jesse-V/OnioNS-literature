The Tor network is a second-generation onion routing system that aims to provide anonymity, privacy, and Internet censorship resistance to its users. In recent years it has grown significantly in response to revelations of national and global electronic surveillance, and remains one of the most popular anonymity networks in use today. Tor is also known for its support of anonymous websites within its network. The domain names for these services are tied to distributed public key infrastructure but suffer from usability challenges due to their randomly-generated addresses. In response to this difficulty, in this work we introduce EsgalDNS, a novel and decentralized Tor-powered DNS that provides unique user-selected domain names to Tor hidden services.
