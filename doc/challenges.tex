\section{Zooko's Triangle}
\label{sec:ZookosTriangle}

One of the largest challenges is inherent to the difficulty of designing a distributed system that maintains a correlation database of human-meaningful names in a one-to-one fashion. The problem is summarized in Zooko's Triangle, an influential conjecture proposed by Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn in late 2001. The conjecture states that in a persistent naming system, only two out of the three following properties can be established:\cite{ferdous2009security}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Human meaningfulness: the names have a quality of meaningfulness and memorability to the users. 
  \item Securely unique: for any name, duplicates do not exist.
  \item Distributed: the naming system lacks a central authority or database for allocating and distributing names.
\end{itemize}

Tor hidden service .onion domains, PGP keys, and Bitcoin addresses are secure and decentralized but are not human-meaningful; they use the large key-space and the collision-free properties of secure digest algorithms to ensure uniqueness, so no centralized database is needed to provide this property. Tradition domain names on the Clearnet are memorable and provably collision-free, but use a hierarchical structure and central authorities under the jurisdiction of ICANN. Finally, human names and nicknames are meaningful and distributed, but not securely collision-free.\cite{stiegler2005petname}
