\section{Zooko's Triangle}

One of the largest challenges is inherent to the difficulty of designing a distributed system that maintains a correlation database of human-meaningful names in a one-to-one fashion. The problem is summarized in Zooko's Triangle, an influential conjecture proposed by Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn in late 2001. The conjecture states that in a persistent naming system, only two out of the three following properties can be established:\cite{Ferdous2009}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Human meaningfulness: the names have a quality of meaningfulness and memorability to the users. 
  \item Securely one-to-one: each name is unique, corresponds to a unique entity or owner, and cannot be forged.
  \item Distributed: the naming system lacks a central authority or database for allocating and distributing names.
\end{itemize}

For example, Tor hidden service .onion addresses and Bitcoin addresses are secure and decentralized but are not human-meaningful. Clearnet domain names are memorable and provably collision-free, but use central database managed DNS under the jurisdiction of ICANN. Finally, human nicknames are meaningful and distributed, but not securely collision-free.\cite{Stiegler2005}

In recent years, systems have been developed that have shown Zooko's Triangle to be false. One prominent example is Namecoin, a naming system which uses a Bitcoin-like blockchain to store name-value pairs. Human-meaningful names can be embedded in the blockchain, which is distributed by nature. The uniqueness of the names is ensured by the Namecoin network and can be verified with anyone holding the blockchain. However, Tor developers have been wary of using Namecoin to store domain names for Tor hidden services. It is also impractical to require all Tor clients to download the entire blockchain before being able to use a hidden service DNS system, and there are inherent security challenges involved with querying servers or the Namecoin network for a registration without being able to use a complete blockchain to verify it. Therefore, another solution is needed.
