\section{Zooko's Triangle}

One of the largest challenges is inherent to the difficulty of designing a distributed system that maintains a correlation database of human-meaningful names in a one-to-one fashion. The problem is summarized in Zooko's Triangle, an influential conjecture proposed by Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn in late 2001. The conjecture states that in a persistent naming system, only two out of the three following properties can be established:\cite{Ferdous2009}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Human meaningfulness: the names have a quality of meaningfulness and memorability to the users. 
  \item Securely one-to-one: each name is unique, corresponds to a unique entity or owner, and cannot be forged.
  \item Distributed: the naming system lacks a central authority or database for allocating and distributing names.
\end{itemize}

For example, Tor hidden service .onion addresses and Bitcoin addresses are secure and decentralized but are not human-meaningful. Clearnet domain names are memorable and provably collision-free, but use central database managed DNS under the jurisdiction of ICANN. Finally, human nicknames are meaningful and distributed, but not securely collision-free.\cite{Stiegler2005}
