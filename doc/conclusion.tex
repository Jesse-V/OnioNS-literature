\chapter{CONCLUSION}

I have presented EsgalDNS, a distributed DNS system inside the Tor network. The system correlates one-to-one human-meaningful domain names and traditional Tor .onion addresses. Tor nodes and clients can both verify the authenticity, integrity, and uniqueness of registrations. Although this design is nowhere near finalized, so far this system seems both promising and novel. I have more work to do, and I am planning to implement and test this system on a simulated Tor network. If accepted by the Tor community, I believe that EsgalDNS will be a valuable infrastructure that will significantly improve the usability and popularity of Tor hidden services.
