\chapter{CONCLUSION}

OnionNS is a distributed DNS system inside the Tor network. The system maps human-meaningful .tor domain names to traditional Tor .onion addresses. It exists on top of current Tor hidden service infrastructure and increases usability of hidden services by abstracting away the base58-encoded hidden service addresses. OnionNS is powered by a randomly chosen set of Tor nodes, whose work can be verified by any party with a copy of Tor's consensus document. Records are self-signed and can be publicly verified. If accepted by the Tor community, OnionNS will be a valuable abstraction layr that will significantly improve the usability and popularity of Tor hidden services.
